Citing reliability in your work
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If `reliability` contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication, please acknowledge this contribution by citing the DOI `10.5281/zenodo.3938000 <https://zenodo.org/record/3938000>`_.

The following reference is using APA:

**Reid, M. (2022). Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering (Version 0.8.2) [Computer software]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.3938000**

If you would like to use another referencing style, the details you may need are:

- **Author:** Matthew Reid
- **Year published:** 2022
- **Title:** Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering
- **Version:** 0.8.2
- **Platform:** Python
- **Available from:** https://pypi.org/project/reliability/
- **DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.3938000

Note that the version number is constantly changing so please check `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/reliability/>`_ for the current version.

If you have used ``reliability`` in any published academic work, I would love to hear about it (alpha.reliability@gmail.com). Depending on the usage, I may provide a link to your work below.
